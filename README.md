***This is the 6th project from OC's web dev formation***
===

In the one we learn how to create and organize a backend environment
This project contains : 
- User interface
- Adding stuff to a DATABASE 
- modifying / deleting / adjust frontend value from user's inputs 


Skills learned : 
* MongoDB 
* Express
* backend security
* nodeJS

--------------------------------------------------------

How to make this project work : 
========

First thing first, use nodeJS 10.0.0

As it is kinda hard to install this version nowadays, you can use NVM in order to have fully acces to any nodeJS version you want. 
go to this repo and install it [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

then process like this : 
`nvm install 10.0.0`
`nvm use 10.0.0`

go to the frontend folder 
=====    
`npm install`
`npm start`

*It'll take a medium amounth of time, and as soon as the project is listening to port 3000 the connection is fine and working*

go to the backend folder 
=====
Then rename the .env.Schema to __.env__ and ajust the variables with you DB informations

`npm install`
`npm start`

by default, the command is node server, but you can modify to nodemon as you wish inside de __package.json__
